# YACRUD
Yet Another CRUD

Making/made this for my first programming with Python class in Summer 2025 for the midterm project.
Really got tired of transferring via Discord a "WIP" and "Working" snapshot between my desktop and my laptop. I guess now is better than ever to learn Github after using it to clone repos for 5+ years.

This isn't anything serious or huge, but it does solve a personal problem of needing a lightweight CRUD for food/misc inventory management to display on my Magic Mirror.

This was written and debugged in a Linux environment with Python version 3.11.X.
Terminal environment supported 256 color and ANSI escape character codes.
Rich module is needed to run.
